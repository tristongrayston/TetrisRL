# Tetris Reinforcement Learning

Tetris was founded in the June of 1984 by a man named Alexey Pajitnov with the goal of making people happy, playing games or
otherwise using his software. The creation of the game started a long lineage of game development; over the span of many years,
it has become clear that Tetris has taken it's place as one of the great classic video games in history. Simple in nature, yet
requiring a significant amount of concentration, it seems that classic games such as tetris are a perfect start in training
machines to learn as humans do. 

This can be solved in two major ways: 
1. The game of tetris can roughly be 'solved' (to a point) with a genetic algorithm.
2. The game of tetris can also roughly be solved with a Q-learning algorithm.
